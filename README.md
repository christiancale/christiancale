# Hello. 👋🏽
.

.

.
## My day-to-day work as a developer.
Determines operational objectives by studying business functions; gathering information; evaluating output requirements and formats. Designs new computer programs by analyzing requirements; constructing workflow charts and diagrams; studying system capabilities; writing specifications.
Improves systems by studying current practices; designing modifications.

## Outside of work.
I enjoy socializing. Going out for a cup of coffee or for some healthy snack, meeting friends. When I have some free time, I take a bicycle and go for a ride, or hit the swimming pool and spend an hour this really depends on my mood and energy levels.

## Let's be friends.
I'm always glad to respond!
